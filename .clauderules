# Critical Rules - Read First

## Before Every Commit
1. Run `yarn run format:fix` (MANDATORY)
2. Run `yarn run check`
3. Run `yarn run lint`
4. Use conventional commits: `type(scope): description #issue`

## Conventional Commit Types
feat, fix, refactor, docs, test, chore, style, perf

## Code Style
- NO JSDoc comments - use inline // comments only
- TypeScript types are documentation
- Keep code self-documenting with clear names

## Framework Versions (DO NOT UPGRADE)
- Svelte v4 (not v5)
- TailwindCSS v3 (not v4)
