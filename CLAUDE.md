# BTC Map Development Guidelines

This file contains project-specific guidelines and commands for Claude Code to follow when working on this codebase.

## Additional Documentation

For comprehensive project architecture, patterns, and development workflows, see:

- [GitHub Copilot Instructions](.github/copilot-instructions.md) - Detailed project overview, framework stack, data architecture, and coding conventions

## Code Quality Commands

### Linting

```bash
yarn run lint
```

Run this command to check for TypeScript and ESLint errors. Always run this before committing changes to ensure code quality.

### Formatting

```bash
yarn run format:fix
```

Run this command to automatically format code according to project standards. Always run this before committing changes.

### Type Checking

```bash
yarn run check
```

Run this command to perform comprehensive TypeScript type checking and Svelte validation. Always run this before committing changes.

## Git Commit Guidelines

Follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) format for all commits:

```
<type>(<scope>): <description> #<issue-number>

[optional body]

### Examples:

- `feat(map): add dark mode toggle #276`
- `fix(area-page): resolve TypeScript errors #345`
- `refactor(api): optimize data fetching logic #123`
- `docs(readme): update installation instructions #456`

### Commit Types:

- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `perf`: Performance improvement
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `test`: Test-related changes
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

### Workflow:

1. Make your changes
2. Run `yarn run format:fix`
3. Run `yarn run check` to perform type checking
4. Run `yarn run lint` to verify no errors
5. Stage and commit with conventional format
6. Include issue number if applicable (e.g., `#276`)

## Project Structure Notes

- `src/lib/sync/elements.ts` always runs first and populates the `$elements` store with `Place[]` data
- Use `Place` type for v4 API data, `Element` type for v2 API data
- Prefer editing existing files over creating new ones
- Only create documentation files when explicitly requested
